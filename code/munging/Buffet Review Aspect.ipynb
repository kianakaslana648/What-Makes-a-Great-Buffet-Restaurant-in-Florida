      "i think the amount of fun you will have here depends on who you go with and what you want to do. i went with my son today (2/23) on a class trip and he was very disappointed. families with toddlers thru preschoolers: they have a great kiddie area that (when my kids were younger) they could play in all day. a big extensive net system that lets them play above the ground. lots of little kiddie rides for them to go on and even a kiddie roller coaster (38\" and up)families with older kids (i'd say 3rd or 4th grade and up) or without kids - the park turns more into a theme park for you with the three roller coasters, mako, kraken, and manta. the height requirement is 54\" and they enforce it! families that are just in it for the shows- there are a lot of them, with lots of different animals. however if you have kids that are too big for the kiddie area and not quite big enough for the actual rides and don't really care about shows--they may be bored.on 2/23 the one \"roller coaster\", atlantis, my son (53\" and bitter, lol) could have gone on was out of commission the entire day. so he was stuck with bland rides that definitely didn't hold a candle to the roller coasters he was desiring. he also wasn't into the shows, which--i mean after all the negative press, it's hard to get excited for and if you've seen one dolphin push a human around, you've seen them all.  the food service was awful. i'll just say it. the park wasn't particularly crowded however we waited 30 mins for every food thing we wanted. i'm glad we brought our lunch bc i can't imagine how much more time we would have wasted waiting for food. the cleanliness was average, the bathrooms were stinky but not disgusting. so, before you set out, figure out who can ride what so there is no sadness on a day you're spending $80 ish per person just to get in the door.\n",

      "where do i start? we brought the kids here for their first time, got there around 9:30 for a 10:00 opening and was glad when they opened early. however, it quickly went downhill from there. once we were in the park, we got in line for manta and were disappointed when the ride shut down for \"technical difficulties.\" that lasted for about 25 minutes or so and many people left. once operational, the ride itself was okay, but actually too slow for my liking. we then proceeded to try some other rides (they only have four roller coasters) and when i say that every single one had an issue, i am not exaggerating! kraken and journey to atlantis were both also experiencing technical difficulties, and mako was temporarily shut down (when we were next in line) for an unexplained weather event as it was not raining, thundering, or lightning!!! dark clouds should not shut down rides! anyway....at journey, we'd just gotten our locker that the attendant told us we needed and when we came back he rudely told us and others that the ride had shut down and to go see guest services if you have an issue with getting money back for your locker as someone inquired. the bright side here is that we basically walked right up to everything as it was not crowded at all, which i may now understand why not. we left journey to ride kraken which was the best ride they have so we were able to ride it back to back as no one was there! by the time we got back to journey, it was fixed. one thing we didn't like about it was all the signage warning you that something was about to happen. no surprises here like it used to be! it kinda took the fun out of the ride.on a positive note, we saw the dolphin and sea lion shows which were pretty good and all of the aquariums and animal encounter exhibits were well done. i personally loved antarctica and the penguins and how they let us ride into their habitat. that was really cool. lastly, the park closed at 6 pm but they started shutting stuff down (stores, carts, etc) at 5 pm to try to usher you out of the park. an employee told us this when we asked why it was already such a ghost town. i have been to many, many, theme parks and have never seen anything like it. to sum it all up, my teenager described it as a broken down six flags, but way worse. save your money and go somewhere else!\n",

      "i wish i found this sooner than another buffet i tried out. it's so dirt cheap with amazing selection that you literally feel like you're being trolled. lunch special is 8.99 and dinner is 11.99. the sushi was pretty good but rice was a bit weird because they all stuck together. spicy tuna was delicious so no complaints here! a semi decent salad bar, good hot foods, good fried foods, and ice cream section. overall, if i were to visit orlando again, this would be the spot to have lunch or dinner!\n"
