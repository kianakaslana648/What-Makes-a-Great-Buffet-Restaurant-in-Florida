              <b>Why Buffets?</b> Compared to a general restaurant analysis, we think diving deeper into a
              specific type of
              restaurant can obtain more interesting and practical insights. In this project, we choose to study the
              buffet
              restaurant market because it is a niche market with great popularity. Buffet restaurants normally offer
              a large variety of food and all-you-can-eat for a set price. With this business model, restaurant owners
              can provide significantly
              different food and services. This project aims to explore what influences a buffet restaurant's rating.

          The goal of the analysis is to find out the key factors that drive buffet restaurant ratings. As seen
          by the plots included in the previous section, buffet restaurants in Florida are getting more popular among
          customers and they have more reviews available that can be utilized for deeper analysis. This data leads to
          some
          questions about the buffet restaurant market.
          Some example questions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Which country category is the most popular to the customers? American? Japanese?</li>
          <li>What are some attributes of buffet restaurants that are related to high review stars?</li>
          <li>Buffet restaurants have a variety of food. What kind of food leads to a higher rating?</li>
          <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The analysis starts by displaying the following innovative plot. Figure 6 combines
          the restaurant information, stars, review counts, and the actual reviews in a single bubble plot. The best
          reviews and worst reviews are sampled from their corresponding restaurant.

            The analysis starts with attributes other than the food and service qualities. While the parking,

          <p>
            Yelp data is notorious for lacking quantitative measurement. We find a way to use "Aspect Extraction"
            together with "Sentiment Analysis" to score each item in customer reviews. For example, if we have two
            reviews from a restaurant "I love the sushi in this restaurant." and "The service is awful here." Our
            algorithm will give "sushi" a positive score between 0 and 1, and give "service" a score between 0 and -1.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, categorizing items from each review into different dimensions generates a series of factors.

            restaurants and their ratings. As the plot shows, there are more than 20 kinds of buffet
            restaurants in Florida with different category combinations. Traditional American, Chinese, and Japanese
            buffets are the most popular in Florida, followed by Indian and Latin buffets with
            relatively better reviews. Also, both brunch and bar buffet restaurants are common, but the former is
            more popular. Among food and drinks, seafood, sushi, pizza, and beer buffets are very hot!

          <p>From Figures 11 and 12, an interesting finding is that there are more American, Chinese, and
            Japanese buffet restaurants than other types, but they are rated worse than the others. It also shows
            in their
            factor scores. Typically, people give higher scores to Brazilian, Halal, and Indian buffets, especially for
            their food, service, and environment. As for variety, Latin, American, and Chinese buffets receive more good
            reviews,
            while Halal buffets get significantly better comments on drinks.

          <p>Figures 13 and 14 show the distribution of buffet restaurants in terms of food categories. A similar
            finding
            from
            these two plots is seafood, sushi, and pizza buffets are more popular in Florida, but they are rated worse
            than steakhouses, barbeque, and vegetarian buffets. Specifically, Vegetarian buffets get the
            highest stars (4.0), and are rated quite well in the environment (0.51), sauce (0.2), and drink
            (0.14). It indicates that people potentially like healthy buffets more. On the other hand, steakhouse
            buffets are mentioned more in good food and service. Besides, barbeque buffets are recommended more for
            their variety.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the above four charts, we can see that the more-restaurants categories tend to have lower ratings than
            the less-restaurants categories. Perhaps, people are inclined to give mediocre ratings to common food types
            in
            buffet restaurants.

            Various visualization techniques are used to get insights from the Florida buffet restaurant market. When
            exploring the Yelp dataset, many aspects can be analyzed. This project
            has studied some factors that differentiate good-rating buffet restaurants from bad-rating ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, it examines some qualitative factors including parking availability, price, category, etc.
            Secondly, since the Yelp dataset
            provides
            a rich collection of customer reviews, we utilize them to extract quantitative measurements on different
            dimensions including food, service, environment, etc.

            Finally, because of food score's strong correlation with buffet restaurant rating, different food categories
            , and food items
            are further investigated. Given the above analysis, conclusions regarding what
            makes good buffet restaurants are garnered, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 18px;">American, Chinese, and Japanese buffet restaurants have the greatest
              popularity,
              while Indian, Brazilian
              , and Halal restaurants enjoy the highest ratings</li>
            <li style="font-size: 18px;">People prefer vegetarian buffets over pizza and sushi buffet</li>
            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Beer, Chili, Curry, and Lamb lead to higher restaurant rating</li>
            <li style="font-size: 18px;">Higher price leads to better customer satisfaction, while parking, reservation,
              and wifi has little
              effect</li>
